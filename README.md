# Three-Scroll Unified Chaotic System

This contains the POV-Ray code for building up the Three-Scroll Unified Chaotic System (TSCUS). The TSUCS contains both a Lorenz-style attractor and also a Lu Chen-style attractor at its extremes. 

This system was introduced by Lin Pan, Wuneng Zhou, Jianâ€™an Fang and Dequan Li in a paper submitted to the International Journal of Nonlinear Science in 2010:
